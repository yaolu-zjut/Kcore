# RK-core: An established methodology for exploring the hierarchical structure within datasets

# Introduction
Recently, the field of machine learning has undergone a transition from model-centric to data-centric. The advancements in diverse learning tasks have been propelled by the accumulation of more extensive datasets, subsequently facilitating the training of larger models on these datasets. However, these datasets remain relatively under-explored. To this end, we introduce a pioneering approach known as RK-core, to empower gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate hierarchical structure within datasets. Across several benchmark datasets, we find that samples with low coreness values appear less representative of their respective categories, and conversely, those with high coreness values exhibit greater representativeness. Correspondingly, samples with high coreness values make a more substantial contribution to the performance in comparison to those with low coreness values. Building upon this, we further employ RK-core to analyze the hierarchical structure of samples with different coreset selection methods. Remarkably, we find that a high-quality coreset should exhibit hierarchical diversity instead of solely opting for representative samples.
